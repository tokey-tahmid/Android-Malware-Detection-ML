# Android-Malware-Detection-ML
I have worked on an android security project as a project manager as well as the lead developer for implementing Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for android malware detection. The Machine Learning model was developed with Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifiers. The Deep Learning model was developed using Google’s Transformer based Masking model ‘BERT’ and MLP (Multilayer Perceptron). I evaluated the performance difference between ML and DL classifiers in detecting zero-day attacks and compared the results with state-of-the-art methods.
